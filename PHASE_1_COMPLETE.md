## 🧪 **HOW TO TEST PHASE 1**

### **1. Test Task Loading**
1. Open your app in Expo Go
2. Navigate to the home screen (tabs)
3. You should see real tasks from your backend instead of hardcoded ones
4. Each task card shows:
   - Creator name (e.g., "Jane F.")
   - Task title 
   - Location
   - Budget amount
   - Number of offers

### **2. Test Search Functionality**
1. Click in the "Post a Task" input field
2. Type any search term (e.g., "move", "repair", "clean")
3. After typing 3+ characters, you'll see filtered results
4. Clear the input to return to all tasks

### **3. Test Loading & Error States**
1. Check console for API logs
2. If backend is offline, you'll see error message with retry button
3. Loading spinner appears while fetching data
